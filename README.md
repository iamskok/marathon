# Welcome to Marathon.

## Aim
To be the very best that ever was.

## How
Help devs teams track their team member efforts and team stats for scrum or general development process

## What
An app to save and structure teams, save tasks completed and context on sprint effort and generate stats and reports on how the team is doing based on the input and historical data

## How it looks so far
A sample "user stats" view where we can display sprints the user belongs to

# Plans
Initially everything will be localStorage saved. I guess IDB could be an options? But I'm lazy to take that as the first approach. So I'm thinking
-> LocalStorage
-> IDB
-> Some other database

Once this last step is completed there will be a data abstraction layer to provide connectors to popular databases or for other people to provide their own data storage implementations.
